# :wolf: Care Instructions for Theo Beekman :dog2:

## Executive summary:
:feet: **FOOT INJURY**:
On March 2nd Theo stepped on something sharp and cut himself on his front
right paw. It's a deep puncture wound and was checked out by the vet. He
is on an antibiotic to prevent infection. Please keep an eye
on it; woresening pain, bleeding or discharges, or swelling will require
an emergency vet visit.

:ramen: **FOOD**: Theo gets 3 scoops (2 cups) of Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance
L.I.D. dogfood, twice a day. To prepare his food add two tablespoons
of [Olewo Carrots] to 1 cup water and microwave for 1 minute. Let
stand until mushy and combine with food. Usually he is fed before
morning walks and before afternoon walks (see below).

:pill: **MEDICATIONS**: Other than the light-sensitive antibiotics, his
pills have been pre-sorted and put into the
old-grandma style pill box. He gets pills twice a day, once in the
morning (usually after walks) and once at night (usually after night
time walks). You can give him his pills wrapped in roast beef :cow:
with or without food. The antibiotics should __*not*__ be given on an
empty stomach if at all possible. Theo gets two Clamavox antibiotic
tablets (from the foil, they're light sensitive so can't be added to
the pill box).

:walking_man: **WALKS**: Theo usually goes out 3 times a day. Once around 8:30 AM,
again around 3:00 PM and again around 10:30 PM before bed. There is
some flexibility here, but in general he should go on 3 walks a day to
prevent accidents or urgent middle of the night requests to go
out. (He will let you know with fairly aggressive whining, which
usually indicates he needs to go out to prevent an accident.) If he is
refusing to go out, you can bribe him with roast beef or marrow snack 
treats to get him out of bed. He can be stubborn, so bribery may be
required. Please put his collar and leash on before giving him any bribe.
Expect 2-4 solid deposits per walk. __DOUBLE CHECK THE BAGS BEFORE 
LEAVING!__ (At least 4 bags are recommended!)

:corn: **CORN UPDATE (foot problem/condition)**: We always feel like we're
playing wack-a-mole with his corns. Theo has a corn on his front
right and back right paws.
Unfortunately there's not a lot that can be done, other than trying
to plan walks on routes with smoother pavement and grass and avoiding
rock salt during winter and rough pavement or gravel. We apply a
topical cream which helps too, but progress is slow.

:hospital: **EMERGENCIES**:
* Regular vet: City Paws 14th St. (202-232-7297)
* After hours/serious emergencies: Friendship Animal Hospital (202-363-7300) ([map])

* If Theo needs to see the Vet or is worked up and is conscious & agitated, please
  give him Trazedone in accordance with the dosing instructions on the bottle
  (two or three tablets, double check please).
* You should bring the basket muzzle with you to the vet in an emergency; you
  may need to utilize it at strategic times, like to get him out of the car.

## :sparkles: About Theo :sparkles:
Theo is a red-fawn male (neutered) greyhound, weighing about 80 lbs,
born on Jan 8, 2010. He raced in Pima County AZ. He's a genius (kinda)
a gentleman about town and a lovey dovey. :heart:

## :pill: Medications :pill:
Theo has anxiety as well as two heart conditions:
 - Tricuspid valve displasia (TVD)
   - TVD is a leaky tricuspid valve leading to a strong heart murmur
     and significant back flow, and, if untreated, eventual congestive
     heart failure. :broken_heart:
 - Arrhythmia (Supraventricular tachycardia)
   - Fast, irregular heartbeat at times. :zap:

### Medications other than the antibiotics have been pre-loaded into grandma-style weekly pill organizers :bento:
Please administer the morning pills after he eats breakfast. Wrap
pills in roast beef to get him to eat them.  Please administer the
evening pills after he eats dinner. If he refuses to eat a meal, after
waiting a while it is OK to give him his pills. Pills other than the Clamavox antibiotics
have been pre-loaded into the pill box pictured below:

![pill box](https://github.com/zbeekman/TheodoreVonKarmanTheGreyt/blob/master/Theo-pill-box.png)

The Clamavox antibiotic (to prevent infection of his foot) is in a white envelope, and
tablet is in a foil blister. Theo gets two Clamavox tablets every 12 hours until gone.
This medication is light sensitive so it cannot be pre-loaded into the pill box.

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Do not crush any pills or mix them in with damp food
or liquids. One medication is a time release tablet.

#### Clamavox Tablets
Individually packaged tablets in a sheet of foil blisters. These are all kept
in a white Clamavox paper envelope. He gets two tablets twice a day. These
should not be given on an empty stomach if possible.

#### Diltiazem extended release (Dilt XR) 60 mg tablets
All white cylindrical tablets. One tablet, twice daily. (120 mg total
in a day) These are used to treat his Arrhythmia.

__*IMPORTANT:*__ accidental double-dosing could lead to an emergency
medical situation.  Please make sure that this pill (white cylindrical
tablet) is only give once every 8 to 12 hours, preferably after he
eats.

#### Benazepril 10 mg tablets
Small, bright white, rounder tablets, white interior. One and a half tablets,
twice daily. (30 mg total in a day) These treat his TVD and help
prevent congestive heart failure.

#### Gabapentin 300 mg capsules
Yellow and orange capsules. These help with calm & anxiety and pain caused by
corns and old racing injuries. Theo gets 1 capsule twice a day.

#### Trazedone 50 mg tablets
In desperate situations, you can give Theo 2 50 mg Trazedone tablets for
anxiety. This should be done if, for example, he was bitten by another dog
and needs to go to the vet.

## Feeding
Theo should eat twice a day. Once in the morning around 8:30 AM and
then once around 6:00 PM. He gets 2 cups of Dick van Patten's limited
ingredient diet venison and sweet potato kibble mixed with 2
tablespoons of Olewo dehydrated carrots re-hydrated in 1 cup warm water 
to firm his stool and aid digestion. If he refuses one or two meals you
can still give him his pills. He's picky and easily stressed out, which is
why he may not be enthusiastic about his food. Eventually he will get 
hungry and eat. Sometimes adding a small treat and/or stirring it can help
entice him to eat.

### Food prep instuctions
Twice a day, add 2 tablespoons of dehydrated [Olewo carrots] to 1 cup water, and
microwave for 1 minute. Let this mixture stand until it has the
consistency of baby food. Add this to 3 scoops (2 cups) of Dick Van
Patten's dry kibble, give it a stir and encourange him to eat.

## Other Health Considerations

### Diarrhea
Unless things get really bad (yelping while pooping etc.) he probably
does not need to see the vet due to diarrhea. Should things get really
bad, then a visit to the vet may be in order. In general, it is a good
idea to ensure that you have at least four bags on hand when walking
him. While on antibiotics, his stools are usually firm and well behaved.

### Heat
Because greyhounds are delicate creatures, and due to his heart
condition, walks during very hot weather should be kept short. Morning
and night time walks can be a bit longer while it is cooler, but
mid-day to early evening walks should be kept short.

### Cold
Greyhounds don't have much fur or fat, so if it is very cold out Theo should
have a jacket of some type. If its below freezing, this should be his red,
fleece lined jacket with outside waterproof material. In cool, but not freezing
weather he has a pretty good fleece he can wear.

### Emergencies
For medical emergencies it may be necessary to muzzle Theo. He has a black
basket muzzel that fits pretty well. He usually is OK with you
putting the muzzle on hime while he's standing, but doesn't like it once
it's on and will try to escape. This is not likely to be necessary, but
you should at least bring it if you need to go to a vet.

In addition if he is hurt, he may become aggressive. Besides muzzling him,
giving him a dose of Trazedone (2-3 tablets, see bottle) will help mellow
him out a little bit. If he is unconscious or having trouble breathing,
then probably hold off on muzzling him and giving him Trazedone; use your
judgement.

Theo's normal vet is City Paws Animal
Hospital, (202) 232-7297, on 14th St. If they are not open, then there
is Friendship Animal Hostpital (202-363-7300), which is open 24/7 and
has emergency facilities. Friendship Animal Hospital is located at
4105 Brandywine St NW, Washington, DC 20016 ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/d3A7yb1sNo82)). 

### Corns
Theo has corns on a number of his paw pads. This is a chronic and
frustrating greyhound specific condition. Because of this he is
sensitive to walking on surfaces like gravel, street grates, and
erroding pavement. He prefers smooth or soft surfaces like grass,
carpet, smooth sidewalks, and crosswalk painted lines. This is just
something to keep in mind when planning activities with him. Curretnly
his front right foot is bothering him the most, and sometimes he will
hop along on three legs when it's really bad.

### Separation Anxiety
If leaving the house at the same time, with bags or work gear, it can
be helpful to ensure that Theo has recently been walked. This will
tire him out a little bit, and reduce any anxiety he may have about
having an accident in the house. If he decides to throw a fit as you
try to leave, after he has calmed down a bit you can ask him to lie
down and give him a "Greenie" treat before walking out. This usually
captivates his attention enough to forget about the fact that you are
leaving him. I doubt you'll have any problems with this, but it's
useful to be aware of strategies should this issue arise.
