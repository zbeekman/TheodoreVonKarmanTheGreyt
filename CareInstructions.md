   - Fast, irregular heartbeat at times.

### All medications have been pre-loaded into a grandma-style weekly pill organizer

Please administer the evening pills after he eats dinner. If he refuses to eat a meal, after waiting a while it is
OK to give him his pills.

#### Diltiazem extended release (Dilt XR) 60 mg tablets

(white cylindrical tablet) is only give once every 10 to 12 hours, preferably after he eats.

#### Benazepril 10 mg tablets

## Feeding
Theo should eat twice a day. Once in the morning around 8 or 9 AM and then once at 6:30 PM. He gets 2 cups of Dick van Patten's limited
ingredient diet venison and sweet potato kibble mixed with a scant 2 tablespoons of Olewo dehydrated carrots to firm his stool and aid
digestion. If he refuses one or two meals you can still give him his pills. He's picky and easily stressed out, which is why he may not
be enthusiastic about his food. Eventually he will get hungry and eat.

### Food prep instuctions
Please combine the contents of 1 zip lock back (2 cups kibble and 2 tbsp dehydrated carrots) with 1 cup warm water and let stand until
the carrots no longer look like pellets. Give it a stir and encourange him to eat.
