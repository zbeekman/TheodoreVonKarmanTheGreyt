## :sparkles: About Theo :sparkles:
Theo is a red-fawn make (neuter) greyhound, weighing about 80 lbs, born on Jan 8, 2010. He raced in Pima County AZ. He's a genius (kinda) a gentleman about town and a lovey dovey. :heart:

## :pill: Medications :pill:
Theo has separation anxiety (SA) as well as two heart conditions:
 - Tricuspid valve displasia (TVD)
   - TVD is a leaky tricuspid valve leading to a strong heart murmur and significant back flow, and,
   if untreated, eventual congestive heart failure. :broken_heart:
 - Arrhythmia (Supraventricular tachycardia)
   - Fast, irregular heartbeat at times. :zap:

### All medications have been pre-loaded into a grandma-style weekly pill organizer :bento:

OK to give him his pills.

his stool and aid digestion. If he refuses one or two meals you can still give him his pills. He's picky and easily stressed out, which

the carrots no longer look like pellets. Give it a stir and encourange him to eat.
