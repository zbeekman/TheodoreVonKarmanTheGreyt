# :wolf: Care Instructions for Theo Beekman :dog2:

## Executive summary:
**FOOD**: Theo gets 3 scoops of Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance
L.I.D. dogfood, twice a day. To prepare his food add two tablespoons
of [Olewo Carrots] to 1 cup water and microwave for 1 minute. Let
stand until mushy and combine with food. Usually he is fed before
morning walks and before afternoon walks (see below).

**MEDICATIONS**: His pills have been pre-sorted and put into the
old-grandma style pill box. He gets pills twice a day, once in the
morning (usually after walks) and once at night (usually after night
time walks). You can give him his pills wrapped in roast beef :cow:
with or without food.

**WALKS**: Theo usually goes out 3 times a day. Once around 8:30 AM,
again around 6:00 PM and again around 10:30 PM before bed. There is
some flexibility here, but in general he should go on 3 walks a day to
prevent accidents or urgent middle of the night requests to go
out. (He will let you know with fairly aggressive whining, which
usually indicates he needs to go out to prevent an accident.) If he is
refusing to go out, you can bribe him with roast beef to get him out of
bed.

## :sparkles: About Theo :sparkles:
Theo is a red-fawn male (neuter) greyhound, weighing about 80 lbs,
born on Jan 8, 2010. He raced in Pima County AZ. He's a genius (kinda)
a gentleman about town and a lovey dovey. :heart:

## :pill: Medications :pill:
Theo has separation anxiety (SA) as well as two heart conditions:
 - Tricuspid valve displasia (TVD)
   - TVD is a leaky tricuspid valve leading to a strong heart murmur
     and significant back flow, and, if untreated, eventual congestive
     heart failure. :broken_heart:
 - Arrhythmia (Supraventricular tachycardia)
   - Fast, irregular heartbeat at times. :zap:

### All medications have been pre-loaded into a grandma-style weekly pill organizer :bento:
Please administer the morning pills after he eats breakfast. Wrap
pills in roast beef to get him to eat them.  Please administer the
evening pills after he eats dinner. If he refuses to eat a meal, after
waiting a while it is OK to give him his pills.

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Do not crush any pills or mix them in with damp food
or liquids. One medication is a time release tablet.

#### Diltiazem extended release (Dilt XR) 60 mg tablets
All white cylindrical tablets. One tablet, twice daily. (120 mg total
in a day) These are used to treat his Arrhythmia.

__*IMPORTANT:*__ accidental double-dosing may lead to an emergency
medical situation.  Please make sure that this pill (white cylindrical
tablet) is only give once every 8 to 12 hours, preferably after he
eats.

#### Benazepril 10 mg tablets
Bright white, rounder tablets, white interior. One and a half tablets,
twice daily. (30 mg total in a day) These treat his TVD and help
prevent congestive heart failure.

## Feeding
Theo should eat twice a day. Once in the morning around 8:30 AM and
then once at 6:00 PM. He gets 2 cups of Dick van Patten's limited
ingredient diet venison and sweet potato kibble mixed with a scant 2
tablespoons of rehydrated Olewo dehydrated carrots to firm his stool
and aid digestion. If he refuses one or two meals you can still give
him his pills. He's picky and easily stressed out, which is why he may
not be enthusiastic about his food. Eventually he will get hungry and
eat. Sometimes adding a small treat and/or stirring it can help entice
him to eat.

### Food prep instuctions
Add 2 tablespoons of dehydrated [Olewo carrots] to 1 cup water, and
microwave for 1 minute. Let this mixture stand until it has the
consistency of baby food. Add this to 3 scoops of Dick Van Patten's
dry kibble, give it a stir and encourange him to eat.

## Other Health Considerations

### Diarrhea
Unless things get really bad (yelping while pooping etc.) he probably
does not need to see the vet due to diarrhea. Should things get really
bad, then a visit to the vet may be in order. In general, it is a good
idea to ensure that you have at least three bags on hand when walking
him.

### Heat
Because greyhounds are delicate creatures, and due to his heart
condition, walks during very hot weather should be kept short. Morning
and night time walks can be a bit longer while it is cooler, but
mid-day to early evening walks should be kept short.

### Emergencies
Zaak can be reached at (917) 797-3239 (m) and Janine at (202) 288-8049
(m). Please don't hesitate to call for any reason, at any hour of the
day or night; we put our phones on "do not disturb" mode at night, so
if it is a serious emergency you can reach us by calling more than
once in rapid succession. Theo's normal vet is City Paws Animal
Hospital, (202) 232-7297, on 14th St. If they are not open, then there
is a magnet on the refigerator for Hope Animal Medical center in
Vienna VA, which is open 24/7 and has emergency facilities. In
addition, Bunny Beekman (Zaak's mom) can be reached at (917) 796-4653
(m).

### Corns
Theo has corns on a number of his paw pads. This is a chronic and
frustrating greyhound specific condition. Because of this he is
sensitive to walking on surfaces like gravel, street grates, and
erroding pavement. He prefers smooth or soft surfaces like grass,
carpet, smooth sidewalks, and crosswalk painted lines. This is just
something to keep in mind when planning activities with him. Curretnly
his front right foot is bothering him the most, and sometimes he will
hop along on three legs when it's really bad.

### Separation Anxiety
If leaving the house at the same time, with bags or work gear, it can
be helpful to ensure that Theo has recently been walked. This will
tire him out a little bit, and reduce any anxiety he may have about
having an accident in the house. If he decides to throw a fit as you
try to leave, after he has calmed down a bit you can ask him to lie
down and give him a "Greenie" treat before walking out. This usually
captivates his attention enough to forget about the fact that you are
leaving him. I doubt you'll have any problems with this, but it's
useful to be aware of strategies should this issue arise.
