# :wolf: Care Instructions for Theo Beekman :dog2:
Saturday 8/13 -- Sunday 8/21

## Executive summary:
**FOOD**: Theo gets 3 scoops of Dick Van Patten's L.I.D. dogfood, twice a day. To prepare his food add two tablespoons of [Olewo Carrots] to 1 cup water and microwave for 1 minute. Let stand until mushy and combine with food.

**MEDICATIONS**: His pills have been pre-sorted and put into the old-grandma style pill box. He gets pills twice a day, once in the morning, and once after dinner. You can give him his pills wrapped in roast beef :cow: with or without food. For the first week, the morning pill is labeled `<day of the week> AM`, and the evening pill is labeled `<day of the week> PM`. After the first week, once these have run out, please give him the pills from the individual baggies, labeled with the date, day of the week and AM or PM.

**WALKS**: Theo usually goes out 3 times a day. Once around 8:30 AM, again around 6:00 PM and again around 10:30 PM before bed. There is some flexibility here, but in general he should go on 3 walks a day to prevent accidents or urgent middle of the night requests to go out. (He will let you know with fairly aggressive whining, which usually indicates he needs to go out to prevent an accident.)

## :sparkles: About Theo :sparkles:
Theo is a red-fawn male (neuter) greyhound, weighing about 80 lbs, born on Jan 8, 2010. He raced in Pima County AZ. He's a genius (kinda) a gentleman about town and a lovey dovey. :heart:

## :pill: Medications :pill:
Theo has separation anxiety (SA) as well as two heart conditions:
 - Tricuspid valve displasia (TVD)
   - TVD is a leaky tricuspid valve leading to a strong heart murmur and significant back flow, and,
   if untreated, eventual congestive heart failure. :broken_heart:
 - Arrhythmia (Supraventricular tachycardia)
   - Fast, irregular heartbeat at times. :zap:

### All medications have been pre-loaded into a grandma-style weekly pill organizer :bento:
Please administer the morning pills after he eats breakfast. Wrap pills in roast beef to get him to eat them.
Please administer the evening pills after he eats dinner. If he refuses to eat a meal, after waiting a while it is
OK to give him his pills.

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Do not crush any pills or mix them in with damp food or liquids. One medication is a time release tablet.

#### Diltiazem extended release (Dilt XR) 60 mg tablets
All white cylindrical tablets. One tablet, twice daily. (120 mg total in a day) These are used to treat his Arrhythmia.

__*IMPORTANT:*__ accidental double-dosing may lead to an emergency medical situation.  Please make sure that this pill
(white cylindrical tablet) is only give once every 8 to 12 hours, preferably after he eats.

#### Benazepril 10 mg tablets
Bright white, rounder tablets, white interior. One and a half tablets, twice daily. (30 mg total in a day) These treat his TVD and help prevent congestive heart failure.

#### Fluoxetine 10 mg capsules
White and green capsules. Two capsules in the morning and one at night. If he misses a few doses of this it is not a problem.
This is to treat his separation anxiety (SA)

## Feeding
Theo should eat twice a day. Once in the morning around 8 or 10 AM and then once at 6:00 PM. He gets 2 cups of Dick van Patten's
limited ingredient diet venison and sweet potato kibble mixed with a scant 2 tablespoons of rehydrated Olewo dehydrated carrots to firm
his stool and aid digestion. If he refuses one or two meals you can still give him his pills. He's picky and easily stressed out, which
is why he may not be enthusiastic about his food. Eventually he will get hungry and eat. Sometimes adding a small treat and/or stirring it can help entice him to eat.

### Food prep instuctions
Add 2 tablespoons of dehydrated [Olewo carrots] to 1 cup water, and microwave for 1 minute. Let this mixture stand until it has the consistency of baby food. Add this to 3 scoops of Dick Van Patten's dry kibble, give it a stir and encourange him to eat.

## Other Health Considerations

### Diarrhea
If Theo has loose stools you can give him 3 to 4 Tylan powder (yellow gel-caps) pills per day. Unless things get really bad (yelping while pooping etc.) he probably does not need to see the vet due to diarrhea. Should things get really bad, then a visit to the vet may be in order. In general, it is a good idea to ensure that you have at least three bags on hand when walking him.

### Heat
Because greyhounds are delicate creatures, and due to his heart condition, walks during very hot weather should be kept short. Morning and night time walks can be a bit longer while it is cooler, but mid-day to early evening walks should be kept short.

### Emergencies
Theo's normal vet is City Paws Animal Hospital, (202) 232-7297, on 14th St. If they are not open, then there is a magnet on the refigerator for Hope Animal Medical center in Vienna VA, which is open 24/7 and has emergency facilities. In addition, Judy Beha (Janine's mom) can be reached at 843-422-7657 and Bunny Beekman (Zaak's mom) can be reached at (917) 796-4653 (m) or (978) 515-7936.

### Corns
Theo has corns on a number of his paw pads. This is a chronic and frustrating greyhound specific condition. Because of this he is sensitive to walking on surfaces like gravel, street grates, and erroding pavement. He prefers smooth or soft surfaces like grass, carpet, smooth sidewalks, and crosswalk painted lines. This is just something to keep in mind when planning activities with him.

### Separation Anxiety
If leaving the house at the same time, with bags or work gear, it can be helpful to ensure that Theo has recently been walked. This will tire him out a little bit, and reduce any anxiety he may have about having an accident in the house. If he decides to throw a fit as you try to leave, after he has calmed down a bit you can ask him to lie down and give him a "Greenie" treat before walking out. This usually captivates his attention enough to forget about the fact that you are leaving him. I doubt you'll have any problems with this, but it's useful to be aware of strategies should this issue arise.
